# 《Slack announces new features to help ease app integration pain》
1、As Slack has **grown in popularity**, one of the company’s key differentiators has been the ability to integrate with otherenterprise 
tools. 

2、**To really take advantage of this capability**, the company is adding a feature to select the five most recent actions from a 
quick-access menu. These actions fill in automatically based on your most recent activities, and could be **a real time-saver** for people 
working inside Slack all day.

3、Finally, the company is **enabling** developers to open an external window inside Slack, what they call Modal windows, which open when 
users have to fill out a form, take a survey, enter expenses or provide additional information outside the flow of Slack itself.
