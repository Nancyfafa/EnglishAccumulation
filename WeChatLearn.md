中华文明是亚洲文明的重要组成部分。自古以来，中华文明在继承创新中不断发展，在应时处变中不断升华，//积淀着中华民族最深沉的精神追求，是中华民族生生不息、
发展壮大的丰厚滋养。中国的造纸术、火药、印刷术、指南针、天文历法、哲学思想、民本理念等在世界上影响深远，有力推动了人类文明发展进程。

**Being an inseparable part of** Asian civilizations, Chinese civilization has, since its early days, evolved and grown by **drawing on 借鉴its past achievement**, exploring new ground and adapting to changes. It represents the profound pursuit of the Chinese nation and provides a rich source of strength for its **lasting development**. Chinese inventions such as paper making, gunpowder, printing and the compass as well as China's **astronomical knowledge, calendar system天文历法**, philosophy and the **people-centered doctrine民本理念** have all had a global impact and **propelled推动** the development of human civilizations.

中华文明是在同其他文明不断交流互鉴中形成的开放体系。从历史上的佛教东传、“伊儒会通”，到近代以来的“西学东渐”、新文化运动、马克思主义和社会主义思想传入中国，再到改革开放以来全方位对外开放，中华文明始终在兼收并蓄中历久弥新。亲仁善邻、协和万邦是中华文明一贯的处世之道，惠民利民、安民富民是中华文明鲜明的价值导向，革故鼎新、与时俱进是中华文明永恒的精神气质，道法自然、天人合一是中华文明内在的生存理念。

Chinese civilization, as **an inclusive and integrated whole兼容并包的整体**, has become what it is today through constant interactions with
other civilizations. It has been enriched by the **introduction** of Buddhism and the confluence of Islam and Confucianism in the old days, 
and by the introduction of Western learning, the launch of the New Culture Movement and the introduction of Marxism and socialism in modern
times. **All-round opening-up全方位对外开放** of the country, starting with the reform and opening-up program, has added to its **vitality n.活力** today. For Chinese civilization, **amity n.友好 and good neighborliness** is the principle guiding our interactions with other 
countries; and to deliver prosperity and security to the people is the **overarching goal首要目标**, to keep pace with the times through 
reform and innovation is the **abiding adj.长久的** commitment, and to achieve harmony between man and nature is the **underlying adj.潜在的，根本的** philosophy.

1.As those historic pictures were beamed back to Earth, millions of us sat transfixed to our television screens, as we watched Neil Armstrong **taking a small step for man and a giant leap for mankind - and, indeed, for womankind**. It's a reminder for us all that **giant leaps often start with small steps**.<br>

3.It's a timely reminder of what positive things can be achieved when people set aside past differences and come together in the spirit of friendship and **reconciliation和解**. And, as we all look forward to the start of a new decade, it's worth remembering that **it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change**.
